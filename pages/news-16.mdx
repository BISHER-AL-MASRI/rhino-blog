# A call for developers

Rhino Linux continues to make great strides in development, but there’s one recurring challenge we face: the need for more active contributors. As we gear up for our [next disk image release](https://github.com/orgs/rhino-linux/projects/8), it’s become increasingly clear that we need to grow our team to sustain our progress.

Our next disk image release is planned to include a multitude of fresh features, including significant improvements to both the Unicorn Desktop and the `rhino-pkg` manager. All of our efforts are driven by a small team of student developers, balancing our work on Rhino Linux with education, employment, and other personal commitments - and in consequence, we often overwork ourselves, as we want to deliver the very best for our community. 

As a team, we’re deeply engaged with both the Rhino Linux community and the broader Linux ecosystem. While we receive valuable, constructive feedback, our limited resources and manpower can make it challenging to address every issue or suggestion as quickly as we’d like to - and trust us, we want to address them all.

That’s why we’re reaching out to you: with such a small core team, we rely on passionate contributors to help us aim higher, tackle bigger projects, and continually improve Rhino Linux.

We need your help to keep this Rhino rolling, and to make it even better. If you're interested, please join [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/reSvc8Ztk3). This is our chosen platform for development communication, and it is essential for development team and contributor communication. We hope to see you there.

Will you join us?

Until next time,
The Rhino Linux Team
