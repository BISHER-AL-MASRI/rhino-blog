# A call for developers

Rhino Linux is continuing to steam through development, although we are consistently presented with one hurdle. As we continue development in preperation for our [next disk image release](https://github.com/orgs/rhino-linux/projects/8), one thing has become very apparent. We need more active contributors.

The next Rhino Linux disk image release, will contain all of the features we have worked on during this time. We've been working tirelessly to improve significant aspects of the distribution, including the Unicorn Desktop. All of this development occurs in between work, university, and our personal lives.

The Rhino Linux Team operates and interacts with both the Rhino Linux, and wider Linux community. Sometimes we will find valid, constructive criticisms about Rhino Linux, but we sometimes lack the resources or manpower to work on those criticisms as fast as we would like to.

We'd like to call on you, the Rhino Linux community to help make Rhino Linux better. Rhino Linux has a relatively small team of consistent contributors, for us to be able to set our sights on bigger targets and working to continually improve our distribution, we need to expand the amount of active contributors we have.

Will you join us?

The Rhino Linux Team.
